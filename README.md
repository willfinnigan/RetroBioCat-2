# RetroBioCat 2.0
RetroBioCat 2.0 (rbc2) is a python package for computer-aided synthesis planning
in biocatalysis.  Version 2 builds on the original RetroBioCat package, creating
a more modular and extendable framework allowing for the incorporation of other
synthesis planning approaches which can be combined together.  This allows for hybrid
synthesis planning, for example combining chemistry and biocatalysis.

Unlike the original RetroBioCat package, rbc2 does not feature a web-app element,
and is instead designed to be used as soley a python package.  This allows for more
flexibility in how the package is used.  

Please see the documentation for more information.
